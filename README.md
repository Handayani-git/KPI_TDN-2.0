## ‚öôÔ∏è Application Data Flow & Metric Calculation

This application transforms daily operational inputs into a real-time analytical dashboard for managers. Here is how the data flows through the system:

### 1. Data Input (Daily Reporting)
The process begins with the operational teams inputting their daily performance metrics through dedicated forms.

-   **Advertiser (ADV) Input**: An ADV user logs in, navigates to the "Lapor Kinerja Iklan" page, and submits a report containing the `date`, `advertiserId`, `platform`, `product`, and `spend`. This action creates a new document in the **`adSpends`** collection in Firestore.

-   **Customer Service (CS) Input**: A CS user logs in and uses two separate forms:
    1.  **"Lapor Leads"**: They submit a report with the `date`, `csId`, `sourceAdvertiserId`, `product`, `sourcePlatform`, and `leadCount`. This creates a new document in the **`leads`** collection.
    2.  **"Lapor Penjualan"**: For each sale, they submit a report with the `date`, `csId`, `advertiserId`, `product`, `quantity`, and `omset`. This creates a new document in the **`sales`** collection.

### 2. Data Processing (Backend Logic)
Once the data is in Firestore, the application's service layer (`managerService.js`, etc.) handles the processing when a dashboard is loaded.

-   **Data Fetching**: When the Manager loads their dashboard for a specific date range, the service queries and fetches all relevant documents from the `adSpends`, `leads`, and `sales` collections within that period.
-   **In-Memory Aggregation**: The service then processes this raw data:
    -   It `SUM`s all `spend` from `adSpends` by advertiser.
    -   It `SUM`s all `omset`, `quantity`, and counts `closing` events (one per sale document) from `sales` by advertiser and by CS.
    -   It `SUM`s all `leadCount` from `leads` by advertiser and by CS.

### 3. Metric Calculation
Using the aggregated data, the `kpiService.js` calculates the key performance metrics:

-   **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**
    -   **Question:** How much revenue is generated for every Rupiah spent on ads?
    -   **Formula:** `Total Gross Omset / Total Budget Ads`
    -   **Example:** Omset `Rp 20jt` / Budget `Rp 5jt` = **ROAS 4.0**.

-   **CAC ADV (%) (Advertising Cost of Sales)**
    -   **Question:** What percentage of gross revenue is spent on ad costs?
    -   **Formula:** `(Total Budget Ads / Total Gross Omset) * 100%`
    -   **Example:** `(Rp 5jt / Rp 20jt) * 100%` = **25%**.

-   **Closing Rate**
    -   **Question:** How effectively does a CS agent convert leads into sales?
    -   **Formula:** `(Total Closing / Total Leads) * 100%`
    -   **Example:** `30 Closings / 150 Leads * 100%` = **20%**.

-   **Average Products per Transaction**
    -   **Question:** On average, how many products are sold in a single transaction?
    -   **Formula:** `Total Quantity / Total Closing`
    -   **Example:** `45 Products / 30 Closings` = **1.5 Products/Transaction**.

### 4. Data Visualization (Dashboard Display)
The processed data is sent back to the React components to be displayed to the Manager in the form of KPI cards, charts, and summary tables. This workflow ensures that any new report submitted by the team immediately updates the analytical insights on the Manager's dashboard.
